# Frontend Exercise

## Prerequisites

You should have `node` and `npm` installed. We've tested this with node 11.7.0 and npm 6.50, but any version of node >= 10.13 should be fine.

## Install

Clone the repo to your local machine. Then,

```bash
npm install
```

## Develop

```bash
npm run dev
```

After Next.js starts, visit http://localhost:3000 (or http://yourvmhost:3000) in your browser. You should see "It works!" on the screen.

## Verify

```bash
npm run verify
```

You should not see any TypeScript errors.
